# The Adventures of Sullivan

This repo contains code from the game I created, "The Adventures of Sullivan" on Steam, written in GML (Game Maker Language).

This was my second coding project ever. It took me two years from knowing nothing about coding, to hitting the launch button on steamworks.

There is 44,000+ lines of code in the game. The files above make up the most important chunks of the game, character movement, enemy movement, spawn systems, chat boxes, camera settings etc. (I still add files from time to time but these make up the most important templates of the critical game objects.)

Note: This code was written between 2016 and 2019, well before I knew anything about data structures and algorithms, version control, and general best practices! I have since obtained a Software Engineering degree and am an anspiring C# developer.
